			Gameplay
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			I tried to describe the gameplay to my mate and he was confused,
			not that it&#39;s terribly difficult to confuse him, but still I
			had to agree - despite my best efforts I had failed to deliver
			a reasonable description.
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			Now you would think maybe it&#39;s too complex or simply makes
			no sense, but the truth is that it all became clearer to him
			when he finally played it - the gameplay is actually familiar
			and quite intuitive.
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-header-text">
			It&#39;s a Tetris clone!
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			It&#39;s not! It has <i>similar</i> gameplay but there are
			some very important differences.
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			We begin on level 1 with 5 lives - to begin with we are
			presented with a simple design that depicts a cube with
			7 layers of depth, each individual layer is a 7x7 grid
			of tiles. the <b>front</b> and <b>back</b> layers are the
			most important - the layers in between being nothing more
			than sort of <i>transportation</i> layers.
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			Blocks which are made up of between 1 and 4 tiles will form
			on the <b>back</b> layer. Qubes has a level of 3-dimensional
			depth, we can think of the layer that is <b>furthest away</b>
			as the back layer on which new blocks will form. Naturally, the
			blocks and tiles look smaller on the back layer than they do
			at the front and the front layer has some opacity so that
			we can easily see new tiles form on the back layer.
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			When the blocks initially appear they are red in colour, they
			will then change to amber then green. During this initial
			stage, before the block turns green and locks we can move it
			around the back layer. Once it turns green and locks we can no longer
			move the block and it will start to fall towards the <b>front</b>
			layer. The front layer is the layer that is closest to us - the
			layer that the falling blocks will land on. The object is to
			complete rows and columns of tiles on the front layer, the
			completed lines will then clear and increase our score. We
			cannot land a tile on top of another tile, this results in a
			clash in which case both tiles disappear and we lose a life.
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-header-text">
			Yeah, a Tetris clone!
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			No! Firstly we cannot rotate a block while it is unlocked, we
			can only move it - we can shift it up or down, but not rotate it.
			What we can do is rotate the front layer while the locked
			block is falling. So a additional element to the gameplay is
			trying to figure out where to position a block then rotate
			the screen orientation to make it fit and complete more lines...
			and it is very challenging!
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			As we continue to play and clear more lines we will level
			up and the game will get faster, levelling up will award you
			an additional life but you can start to lose them in rapid
			succession.
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-header-text">
			I still don&#39;t get it...
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			I know, I still struggle to describe the game, it really is
			best just to play which is why I've set up a demo on <b>github</b>
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			You can check out the <a class="link-text" href="">demo</a>. Or,
			if you want to check out the source code then go <a class="link-text"
			href="">here</a>. It's written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery - no
			server required, you can simply download the <a class="link-text"
			href="">rar</a> archive, unpack it to your desktop and open the
			index.html in your browser and start playing.
		</p>
		
		<p class="regular-text">
			The game is still a work in progress, I&#39;m trying to get
			as much done in my spare time as possible. The game itself
			is reasonably complex so if anyone comes across any odd
			glitches or bugs when playing I&#39;d very much like to know.
