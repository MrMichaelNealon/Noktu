    Before founding <b>GrovePeak</b>, Francisco was the co-head of 
    HarbourVest&#39;s Latin American office, co-leading all investment 
    and fundraising efforts. <br/><br/>
    
    While at HarbourVest he raised ~$1.4bn from 21 LPs in 3 different 
    countries. Prior to HarbourVest, he was responsible for managing 
    the private equity portfolio at Porvenir, Colombia&#39;s largest 
    pension fund. Francisco&#39;s previous experience includes different 
    positions at two different investment bank boutiques.<br/><br/>

    Having prior experience at a local pension fund, a leading Fund of 
    Funds and working with some local placement agents, <b>GrovePeak</b> 
    is knowledgeable on the local market and what are the keys to success.
