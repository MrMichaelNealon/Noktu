<p style="clear: both; padding-top: 24px;">   
    Before founding Grovepeak, Francisco was the co-head of HarbourVestâ€™s
    Latin American office, co-leading all investment and fundraising efforts. While
    at HarbourVest he raised ~$1.4bn from 21 LPs in 3 different countries. Prior to
    HarbourVest, he was responsible for managing the private equity portfolio for
    Porvenir, Colombiaâ€™s largest pension fund. Franciscoâ€™s previous experience includes
    different positions at two different investment bank boutiques.

<p>
    Having prior experience at a local pension fund, a leading Fund of Funds and
    working with some local placement agents, Grovepeak is knowledgeable on
    the local market and what are the keys to success.

    <b>How will I do it?</b><br/>

    Being based in Colombia, and having worked with other placement agents, I
    have designed my way of raising capital. My goal is to help you raise as much
    capital as possible in the easiest way. Knowing the local LPs and being close
    to them, I will do significant pre-marketing efforts, so you can meet genuine
    prospects that fit your investor profile.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Why me</b><br/>

    Born and raised in Colombia, I speak fluent Spanish and I have always done
    business in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Education</b><br/>

    I received a degree in Business Administration, with a minor in Finance, from
    Universidad de los Andes in BogotÃ¡, Colombia in 2004 and participated in
    Harvard Business Schoolâ€™s Executive Education Program, Strategic Financial
    Analysis for Business Evaluation in 2010.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Investment banking experience</b><br/>

    Starting in 2002, I worked at two different mergers and acquisition boutiques.
    The first one, Estrategias Corporativas, based in Colombia and focused in
    local and cross-border deals. The second one, Violy & Company, based in
    New York and focused in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Primary investing and pension fund regulation</b><br />
    I joined Porvenir, Colombiaâ€™s largest pension fund, in 2008 soon after the regulation
    changed and Colombian pension funds were allowed to invest in
    non-local Private Equity Funds.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Raising capital and Primary investing</b><br/>

    I joined HarbourVest in 2011 with two main responsibilities: (i) to deploy capital
    in the region across three different strategies: primaries, secondaries, and
    co-investments; and (ii) to raise capital from local investors focusing on
    Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Results</b><br/>

    Should you have interest in learning more about my prior experience, how can
    I help you and why you should raise capital in Latin America, I will be more
    than happy to have a discussion with you.
