    We believe in exclusivity and quality over quantity, therefore we only
    accept one mandate at a time.

    <b>The Grovepeak Way</b> of raising capital is the result of over 10 years of
    experience investing and raising capital for Private Equity Funds, having
    worked at one of the largest pension funds in the region, one of the
    leading global Fund of Funds Managers and having worked with other
    placement agents.

<p>
    Our methodology is a refined process to minimize the Managerâ€™s work
    load and maximize capital raised. Grovepeak will lead the pre-marketing
    efforts, in order to identify genuine prospects, and then work alongside
    the Fund Manager during the closing process to optimize time and
    resources.
